# 682. Baseball Game## DescriptionThis problem involves keeping scores for a baseball game with a set of unique rules. Starting with an empty score record, you are provided with a list of string operations where each operation can be:- An integer `x`: Record a new score of `x`.- `"+"`: Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.- `"D"`: Record a new score that is double the previous score.- `"C"`: Invalidate and remove the previous score.You need to return the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations.## Examples### Example 1**Input:** ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]**Output:** 30**Explanation:**- "5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].- "2" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].- "C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].- "D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].- "+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].  Total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.### Example 2**Input:** ops = ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]**Output:** 27**Explanation:**- "5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].- "-2" - Add -2 to the record, record is now [5, -2].- "4" - Add 4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, 4].- "C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5, -2].- "D" - Add 2 * -2 = -4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4].- "9" - Add 9 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9].- "+" - Add -4 + 9 = 5 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5].- "+" - Add 9 + 5 = 14 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5, 14].  Total sum is 5 + -2 + -4 + 9 + 5 + 14 = 27.### Example 3**Input:** ops = ["1","C"]**Output:** 0**Explanation:**- "1" - Add 1 to the record, record is now [1].- "C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [].  Total sum is 0.## Constraints- 1 <= operations.length <= 1000- operations[i] is "C", "D", "+", or a string representing an integer in the range [-3 * 10^4, 3 * 10^4].- For operation "+", there will always be at least two previous scores on the record.- For operations "C" and "D", there will always be at least one previous score on the record.## Topics- Array- Stack- Simulation## Companies- This problem has been used in interviews for numerous tech companies.## Solution```gofunc calPoints(operations []string) int {    var stack []int    var result int		for i := 0; i < len(operations); i++ {        switch operations[i] {        case "+":            if len(stack) > 1 {                result += stack[len(stack)-1] + stack[len(stack)-2]                stack = append(stack, stack[len(stack)-1]+stack[len(stack)-2])			}        case "D":            result += stack[len(stack)-1] * 2            stack = append(stack, stack[len(stack)-1]*2)        case "C":            if len(stack) > 0 {                result -= stack[len(stack)-1]                stack = stack[0 : len(stack)-1]            }        default:            val, _ := strconv.Atoi(operations[i])            stack = append(stack, val)            result += val		}    }    return result}```
