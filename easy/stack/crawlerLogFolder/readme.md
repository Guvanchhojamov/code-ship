# Leetcode File System Operations## 1598. Problem DescriptionThe Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a change folder operation. The operations are described as follows:- `"../"` : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, remain in the same folder).- `"./"` : Remain in the same folder.- `"x/"` : Move to the child folder named `x` (This folder is guaranteed to always exist).You are given a list of strings `logs` where `logs[i]` is the operation performed by the user at the `i-th` step.The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in `logs` are performed.Return the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after the change folder operations.## Example### Input: `logs = ["d1/","d2/","../","d21/","./"]`### Output: 2### Explanation: `Use this change folder operation "../" 2 times and go back to the main folder.`### Input## Solution```gofunc minOperations(logs []string) int {    var level int	for _, log := range logs {		switch log {		case "./":			continue		case "../":			if level > 0 {				level -= 1			}		default:			level += 1		}	}	return level}```
