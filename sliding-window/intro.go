/*
Intro for sliding window and two pointer playlist. from tuf.
There few patterns for where we can use sliding window or two pointer patterns:
1. Constant window.
2. Longest subarray/substring (window size) with <condition>
3. Number of subarrays where condition <condition>
	- solution comes using pattern-2, with separating condition 2 or more parts.
4.Shortest/Minimum window <condition>
- pattern-1 used in more problems. Simple keep correct window problems.
- p-2 used median number of problems.
- in 3 also we use p1 or p2 with separating condition to parts.
- p-4 is more less problems with this related tasks.
*/
/*
 Let's solve simple example questions for each pattern.
p1+p2:
-Constant window: Print all windows with len k
-Largest substring/subarray (size) with sum<=k.
p3:
- Number of subarrays where sum=k
p4:
- Shortest/Minimum subarray with sum >= k
