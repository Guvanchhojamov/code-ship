/*
 Implement stack using linked list

Practice:
Pre-requisites: Basic knowledge of stack and operations in the linked list.

Introduction
Stack is a linear data structure in which elements are stored like a pile, i.e. one on top of another.

The following diagram represents a simple stack

Following operations can be performed in the stack:

push(): pushes an element at the top of the stack.
pop(): removes an element from the top of the stack.
size(): returns the size of the stack.
isEmpty(): returns a boolean value for whether the stack is empty or not.
peek()/top(): returns the top element of the stack.
Implementation of stack
The stack can be implemented in two ways:

Statically:  Using arrays
Dynamically: Using a linked list
In this article, weâ€™ll focus more on the implementation of a stack using a linked list.

type Node struct {
	Val  int
	Next *Node
}

type StackLL struct {
	Head *Node
}

func NewStackLL() StackLL {
	return StackLL{}
}

func (s *StackLL) Push(x int) {
	new := &Node{
		Val: x,
	}
	new.Next = s.Head
	s.Head = new // change head, add new element.
}

func (s *StackLL) Pop() int {
	if s.Head == nil {
		panic("pop from empty stack.")
		return -1
	}
	tmp := s.Head
	s.Head = s.Head.Next
	return tmp.Val
}

func (s *StackLL) Top() int {
	if s.Head != nil {
		return s.Head.Val
	}
	return -1
}

func (s *StackLL) Empty() bool {
	return s.Head == nil || s.Head.Val == 0
}

/*
 How about queue with Linked List?
In queue too like similar linked list iteration.
We keep the head and add (link) ne elements from back, instead of changing head itself.
So, this will be first in first out then.
